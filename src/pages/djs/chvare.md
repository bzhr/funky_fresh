Born In Skopje, Macedonia in 1983, DJ Chvare grew up listening to hip hop, funk, soul, jazz and reggae. 

Inspired by the old school sound of hip hop he started spinning records in local bars around Skopje when he was 17 and turned out to be one of the most distinguished DJs in Macedonia since. Having spent many years playing at all of the major local night clubs (alongside local hard-hitters and national acts alike), holding multiple residencies, DJing special events and promoting his own shows, DJ Chvare has had a lot of time to develop his sound in various styles and genres with a focus on hip hop, funk and jazz.

Apart from his regular performances in Macedonia, he also performed abroad around the Balkans, Spain, Netherlands, Czech Republic, Thailand, Cyprus etc.
